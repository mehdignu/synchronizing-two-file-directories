# synchronizing-two-file-directories

code for synchronizing two file directories, which we’ll call the source and the destination:

    If a file exists in the source but not in the destination, copy the file over.

    If a file exists in the source, but it has a different name than in the destination, rename the destination file to match.

    If a file exists in the destination but not in the source, remove it.
